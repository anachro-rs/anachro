# Network Protocol

## Planes

The Anachro Protocol exposes four different "planes" of communication, each with differing reliablity and usage profiles.

You can read more about Planes in the [Planes Sub Section](./planes.md)

## Layers

The Anachro Protocol is implemented across seven distinct layers, separated to make it easier to port the Anachro Protocol to new transports and physical hardware.

You can read more about layers in the [Layers Sub Section](./layers.md)
