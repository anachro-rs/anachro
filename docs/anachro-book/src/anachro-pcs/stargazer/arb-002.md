# Arbitrator

![Stargazer Arbitrator](./../../images/stargazer-arb-002.jpg)

The first Stargazer Arbitrator module was based on an Adafruit nRF52840 Express. It required no additional components.

It was built on top of an RC2014 Prototype card.

Note that Pin 1 was actually **ABOVE** the card, as the Prototype card only had 39 pins.

For a list of signal lines, please see the [Backplane Page](./backplane.md).
