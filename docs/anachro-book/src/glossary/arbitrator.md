# Arbitrator

The arbitrator is responsible for acting as the central connection for all cards.

In the Anachro protocol, the Arbitrator serves as a local server, providing pub/sub capabilities, card-to-card communication, and discovery of other cards.

On Anachro-PCs, the arbitrator serves a similar role to the Northbridge in desktop PCs: managing access to shared resources such as system memory and communication busses.

The Arbitrator also may serve as a connection adapter between different data link protocols, such as SPI, UART, TCP, or ESB.
